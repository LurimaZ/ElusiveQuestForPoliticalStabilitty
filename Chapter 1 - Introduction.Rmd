In the aftermath of World War II, as the new Asian and African states rose from the dying European colonial empires, the key concept used by most political scientists and policy makers around the world for understanding and guiding the political, economic, and social development of these new states was "modernization." Summarizing the assumptions of "modernization theory," Francis Fukuyama states that:   

> Modernization theorists placed a strong normative value on being modern, and in their view, the good things of modernity tended to go togther. Economic development, changing social relationships like urbanization and the breakdown of primary kinship groups, higher and more inclusive levels of education, normative shifts towards values like 'achievement' and rationality, secularization, and the development of democratic political institutions were all seen as an interdependent whole. [Francis Fukuyama, foreword to @huntingtonPoliticalOrderChanging1968, p. xii]

However, just a few decades later, Samuel Huntington challenged these assumptions by asserting, among other things, that "political decay was at least as likely as political development, and that the actual experience of newly independent countries was one of increasing social and political disorder" [@huntingtonPoliticalOrderChanging1968, p. xii]; and furthermore, by drawing a conclusion from his observations that:   

> Political order was a good thing in itself and would not automatically arise out of the modernization process. Rather the contrary: without political order, neither economic nor social development could proceed successfully. [@huntingtonPoliticalOrderChanging1968, p. xiii]

Ultimately, as Fukuyama puts it, Huntington's concept of *political order* "finally killed off modernization theory" when, in addition to his attacks on its assumptions, the "critique from the Left" argued that:   

> Modernization theorists enshrined an ethnocentric European or North American model of social development as a universal one for humanity to follow. American social science found itself suddenly without an overaching theory, and began its subsequent slide into its current methodological Balkanization. [@huntingtonPoliticalOrderChanging1968, pp. xiii-xiv]   


Since the end of the Cold War, however, as the number of armed conflicts within and between the new states dramatically increased and many of them were barely able to survive, other political scientists and policy makers came up with yet other new concepts to understand their situation and guide them through the process of political, economic, and social development. First, there was the concept of "political stability" (or its opposite, "political instability"),^[We will use the term "political stability/instability" throughout this study "political stability" or its opposite, "political instability," can be used interchangeably.] which was already used by Huntington with that of "political order," although it was not his main focus. [-@huntingtonPoliticalOrderChanging1968, pp. 78-92]. Then, since the 1990s, other concepts, such as "failed state," "state failure," "weak state," and "fragile state," were also used simulatneously with that of "political stability/instability." Nevertheless, it appears that the latter concept is the most frequently used to describe the political situation of most states in the world, whether they were successful or failing, strong or fragile. In fact, as Susan Woodward reports, even "the State Failure Task Force funded by the CIA had changed its title to the Political Instability Task Force in 2003, and the National Intelligence Council (the policy think tank for the CIA) decided in 2005 to establish a semi-annual Political Instability Watch List." [@woodwardIdeologyFailedStates2017, p. 48] Meanwhile, even though the Center for Systemic Peace and the Fund for Peace each have their own "fragility index,"^["State Fragility Index (SFI)" for the Center for Systemic Peace, and "Fragile State Index (FSI)" for the Fund for Peace] in replacement of the flawed "Failed State Index" [@woodwardIdeologyFailedStates2017, p. 22], these new indices and their related databases [@centerforsystemicpeaceINSCRDataPage2018; @marshallGlobalReport20172017; @thefundforpeaceFragileStatesIndex2017] are not as commonly used and practical as those of Daniel Kaufman and his associates'indicators and database, which are adopted and housed by the World Bank under the umbrella of *World Governance Indicators* [See @worldbankWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2016; and @kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011].   


Given the fact that the concept of political stability/instability is more commonly used and practical than the other concepts to describe the political situation of the new states (and any other states in the world for that matter), and given the sheer number of studies that have been already undertaken by various scholars on this issue,^[A Google Scholar search on the keyword *political stability* would for instance yield about 3,430,000 results, and a search on the keyword *state fragility* only 365,000.] this study will also focus on the quest for political stability/instability in Africa.   


As discussed below, the concept of political stability/instability can be defined and measured in many different ways by different scholars. Nevertheless, no matter how it is defined and measured, most scholars are now generally accepting that political stability/instability has tremendous impacts on the economic and social development of any state in the world. [@aisenHowDoesPolitical2011; @alesinaPoliticalInstabilityEconomic1996; and @roePoliticalInstabilityEffects2011]Due to this powerful impacts, anyone involved in any aspect of development in Africa is looking for political stability for the continent. In connection with this, the African Union points out in its Constitutive Charter "the fact that the scourge of conflicts in Africa constitutes a major impediment to the socio-economic development of the continent and of the need to promote peace, security and stability as a prerequisite for the implementation of our development and integration agenda" [@africanunionConstitutiveActAfrican2000, Preamble]. Consequently, one of the main objectives of the African Union is "to promote peace, security, and stability on the continent" [@africanunionConstitutiveActAfrican2000, Article 3.f]. For the international donors, political stability in Africa has been a major concern since the end of the Cold War. Particularly, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have undertaken and supported countless research projects and publications on this issue. Among many others, the major research projects sponsored by the World Bank include those undertaken by Paul Collier and his associates on "Understanding Civil War" [@collierUnderstandingCivilWar2005] and "Breaking the Conflict Trap: Civil War and Development Policy" [@collierBreakingConflictTrap2003]. More specifically, the *World Development Report* for the year 2011 was devoted to "Conflict, Security, and Development." [@worldbankWorldDevelopmentReport2011a] Nevertheless, despite all of these efforts undertaken by different actors, as we will see in this book, Africa is still the most unstable region of the world, and the quest for political stability appears to be elusive for many African countries.   


## What is Political Stability? An Elusive Definition and Measurement

The definition and measurement of the concept of political stability (and/or its opposite, instability) remain controversial, if not elusive, despite the efforts deployed by different scholars and international organizations over the years to come up with a consensual definition and measurement. This situation led some authors to believe that "stability cannot be quantified and that there are thus no degrees of stability" [@dowdingMeaningUsePolitical1983]. In fact, the definition and measurement of this concept have evolved over the years.   

In the 1970s, an early formal definition proposed by Claude Ake states that "political stability is the regularity of the flow of political exchanges" [@akeDefinitionPoliticalStability1975, p. 273]. Unfortunately, no one (including the author himself) could build a cross-national and longitudinal database on political stability based on this definition. Since then, several scholars simply identify political stability with lack of conflict or the ability of a political system to "prevent conflict" and survive. [@reynal-querolPoliticalSystemsStability2002, p. 465] In this sense, many of them use the occurence of conflict and/or the durability of political system as the main indicators of political stability or instability [@goldstoneGlobalModelForecasting2010]. In addition, a fairly common measurement of political stability/instability is the frequency of cabinet change and regime change (or regime duration). The long list of authors who use this type of measurement includes Alesina et al. [-@alesinaPoliticalInstabilityEconomic1996] in their investigation of the impacts of political instability economic growth, Hegre et al. [-@hegreDemocraticCivilPeace2001] in their study on the association between regime type and national security, and Gates et al. [-@gatesInstitutionalInconsistencyPolitical2006a] in their examination of "how political institutional structures affect political instability." Moreover, a closer look at the concept of political instability "using 25 political instability indicators in an Exploratory Factor Analysis," allow Richard Jong-A-Pin to suggest four dimensions of political instability:  "(1) politically motivated violence, (2) mass civil protest, (3) instability within the political regime, and (4) instability of the political regime." [@jong-a-pinMeasurementPoliticalInstability2009, p. 16]   

In recent years, the World Bank and different authors adopt the definition and measurement of "Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism (PV)" proposed by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi, as part of their work on the *World Governance Indicators* (WGI). [@worldbankWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2016; and @kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011] "Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism (PV)" or simply "political stability" is here defined as "the likelihood that the government will [or will not] be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including politically-motivated violence and terrorism. It is considered as one of the "six dimensions of governance," which include: "Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption." [@kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011, p. 4] More importantly, Kaufman et al.'s innovation in this research project is to "rely exclusively on perceptions-based governance data sources." [@kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011, p. 5] As they explain, "Our data sources include surveys of firms and households, as well as the subjective assessments of a variety of commercial business information providers, non-governmental organizations, and a number of multilateral organizations and other public-sector bodies." [@kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011, p. 5]   


We decide to adopt Kaufmann and his associates' definition and measurement of political stability in this study for two reasons. First, since the concept of political stability is highly subjective, it would make more sense to use a measurement technique based on intersubjective scale, like the "Lickert Scale," that is commonly used as a valid measurement technique in various social science disciplines.[@joshiLikertScaleExplored2015; see also @hollwayDoingQualitativeResearch2000; @charmazConstructingGroundedTheory2006] Second, based on their definition and measurement, Kaufmann and his associates are able to build and maintain a consistent database on political stability for most countries in the world since 1996. This database is easily accessible through the World Bank's databank website. [@worldbankWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2016] It is also worth noting that when we compare Kaufman and his associates' political stability score estimates with the Center of Systemic Peace's durability variable (which is included in Polity IV dataset) and State Fragility Index (SFI), as well as the Fund for Peace's Fragile State Index (FSI), we find that these four variables are correlated with high statistical significance (or p-value).^[See Fig. 1.1] While political stability estimate is weakly correlated with regime durability (with the correlation coefficient of 0.51), it is nonetheless strongly correlated with SFI and FSI (with respectively a correlation coefficient of -0.79 and -0.82). This means that political stability estimate, which is based on intersubjective measurement, somehow captures some realities as the SFI and FSI, which are based on the objective measurements of different variables.^[For more information on the Center of Systemic Peace's State Fragility Index (SFI), see @marshallGlobalReport20172017; and for more information on the Fund for Peace's Fragile State Index (FSI), see @thefundforpeaceFragileStatesIndex2017a]

## Why Does Political Stability Matter?


With a very few exceptions, every study on the relationship between political stability and economic performance finds a positive effect of the former on the latter. In other words, lack of political stability (or political instability, with its different forms and degrees, including political crisis and armed conflicts) is associated with poor economic and social development. The only exceptions we find in the literature so far are that of Campos and Nugent who assert that there is no evidence of a "causal and negative long-run relation between political instability and economic growth." [@camposWhoAfraidPolitical2002, p. 157]


Also, most of the early studies reveal the negative consequence of political instability on economic growth. According to Alesina et al.'s classical study, "political instability defined as a propensity for government change had a negative impact on growth." [@alesinaPoliticalInstabilityEconomic1996] In the same vein, Aisen and Veiga also find "higher degrees of political instability are associated with lower growth rates of GDP per capita." [@aisenHowDoesPolitical2011, p. 1] In addition, they specify that "political instability adversely affects growth by lowering the rates of productivity growth and, to a smaller degree, physical and human capital accumulation." [@aisenHowDoesPolitical2011, p. 1]   

More recent studies expand the negative impacts of political instability on other economic and social indicators, such as foreign direct investment (FDI) [See, for instance, @bradaEffectsTransitionPolitical2006; @phungImpactInstitutionalPolitical2017; and @gedaDeterminantsForeignDirect2018], inflation [@aisenDoesPoliticalInstability2006], food security [@deatonPoliticalInstabilityFood2015], social inequality and poverty [@roePoliticalInstabilityEffects2011]. Everyone who investigates the relationships between political stability and inflows of FDI agrees with Brada et al. that while political stability "increase the volume of FDI inflows," political instability reduce their inflows [@bradaEffectsTransitionPolitical2006, p. 649]. Furthermore, Aisen and Veiga find that "a higher degree of political instability is associated with higher inflation," which in turn "generates inefficiencies that reduce society's welfare and economic growth." [@aisenDoesPoliticalInstability2006, p. 1379]


Moreover, other recent studies also show the important role of political stability as an enabling factor that helps other economic factors to be more efficient. In connection with this, investigating the effects of foreign development assistance on African economies, Cai et al. find that "international aid can promote economic growth in Africa, but the effectiveness of aid depends on countries’ political stability." [@caiHasInternationalAid2018, p. 239]   


In sum, political stability is crucial for the economic and social development of any country in the world. Its absence is generally associated with a poor economic and social development in different countries.  As we will see in the next chapter, Africa remains the most unstable region in the world since the end of the Cold War. In line with this, the main purpose of this study is to address the question of why is this the case and why the quest for political stability seems to be elusive for many African countries.


## Approach to Political Stability and Research Methodology

In one of our previous works, we used a "conflict approach" to analyze the political crisis in March 2009 in Madagascar. [@ratsimbaharisonPoliticalCrisisMarch2017] As a result, we come to the conclusion that a conflict approach is an appropriate way to understand the emergence of a political crisis, which can be considered as an escalation of conflict from a previous stage of political instability. In a similar fashion, we also want to  use the conflict approach to understand the emergence of political instability in different African countries, as an escalation of conflict from a previous stage of political stability.   

Following Micheal Lund's "curve of conflict" [@lundPreventingViolentConflicts1996], political instability is considered as the result of the escalation of conflict from the stage of political stability to that of political crisis. Just as in our previous work on the political crisis in Madagascar, our approach to conflict analysis is also based on that of Levinger [-@levingerConflictAnalysisUnderstanding2013], which specifically focuses on the "condition of instability" and "triggering events" (or triggers) in his analysis of conflict. In this sense, we agree with Levinger's analogy, according to which "the condition of instability provides the tinder for conflict, which needs only a spark [or trigger] to burst into flame." [@levingerConflictAnalysisUnderstanding2013, p. 32] Furthoremore, following Levinger states, "the escalation from peace [or political stability] to instability, and ultimately to violent conflict and war, is never inevitable. Without a spark, or triggering event, an unstable situation may persist without erupting to violence -- just as dry and hot conditions in a forest do not always result in a forest fire."[@levingerConflictAnalysisUnderstanding2013, pp. 32-33]   


In addition to the application of this conflict approach, we also intend to use a "mixed methods research" in this study. In line with Creswell agreement, the use of this particular research method is justfied in this case for the following reasons: "It is appropriate to use mixed methods when the use of quantitative research or qualitative research alone is insufficient for gaining an understanding of the problem." [@creswellConciseIntroductionMixed2015, pp. 14-15] Specifically, the quantitative research method will be used to determine the political, economic, social, and cultural conditions of conflict across the African continent. Existing quantitative data from different sources, particularly the World Bank, Freedom House, and the Center for Systemic Peace, will be collected and analyzed using various packages from the "R Project for Statistical Computing." Next, existing qualitative data from different sources are also collected and analyzed using the same "R Project for Statistical Computing," and particularly the RQDA package for qualitative data analysis.


## The Argument of the Book

As mentioned earlier, the main objective of this book is to identify the determinants (or factors) of political instability, along with the actors' behaviors that trigger the escalation of conflicts from the stage of political stability to that of political instability. In a nuttshell, the argument that will be developped throughout the book is that the existence of persistent conditions that are favorable for the emergence and escalation of conflicts makes political stability precarious in many African countries. In addition to these conditions, the behaviors of most actors on these African countries are also most likely to contribute to the emergence and escalation of conflicts in these countries.
