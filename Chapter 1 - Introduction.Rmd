## Political Stability and the African Development

No matter how it is defined and measured, it is now widely accepted that political stability (or, its opposite, political instability) has tremendous impacts on the economic growth and the general wellbeing of the people in any country in the world. [@aisenHowDoesPolitical2011; @alesinaPoliticalInstabilityEconomic1996; and @roePoliticalInstabilityEffects2011] Given these tremendous impacts, any actor at any level (local, national, and international), involved in any aspect of development in Africa, is seeking political stability for the continent.  

Thus, in the preamble of its Constitutive Charter, the African Union points out among the important motivations for the creation of the organization: "the fact that the scourge of conflicts in Africa constitutes a major impediment to the socio-economic development of the continent and of the need to promote peace, security and stability as a prerequisite for the implementation of our development and integration agend" [@africanunionConstitutiveActAfrican2000, Preamble]. Consequently, one of the main objectives of the African Union is "to promote peace, security, and stability on the continent" [@africanunionConstitutiveActAfrican2000, Article 3.f].   

For the international donors, political stability in Africa has been also a major concern since the end of the Cold War. Particularly, international organizations, such as the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme, convinced that Africa would not develop without political stability, have undertaken and supported countless research projects and publications on this issue. Some of the major research projects sponsored by the World Bank were those undertaken by Paul Collier and his associates on "Understanding Civil War" [@collierUnderstandingCivilWar2005] and "Breaking the Conflict Trap: Civil War and Development Policy" [@collierBreakingConflictTrap2003a]. Specifically, the *World Development Report* for the year 2011 was devoted to "Conflict, Security, and Development." [@worldbankWorldDevelopmentReport2011a]

Yet, as of the writing of this book, Africa is still the most unstable region of the world, and stability appears to be more elusive than ever on the continent. 


## Political Stability: An Elusive Definition

What exactly is political stability (or instability)? The definition and measurement of the concept of political stability (and/or its opposite, instability) remain controversial despite the great efforts deployed by different scholars and international organizations on this issue over the years, and no one seems to be able to come up with a consensual definition and measurement yet. This situation led some authors to believe that "stability cannot be quantified and that there are thus no degrees of stability"[@dowdingMeaningUsePolitical1983].   

An early formal definition proposed by Claude Ake in the 1970s simply states that "political stability is the regularity of the flow of political exchanges" [@akeDefinitionPoliticalStability1975, p. 273]. Unfortunately, no one (including the author himself) was able to build a cross-national and longitudinal database on political stability based on this definition. Thus, several scholars simply identify political stability with lack of conflict or the ability of a political system to "prevent conflict" [@reynal-querolPoliticalSystemsStability2002, p. 465], and use "conflicts" from the existing databases as the main indicators of "political instability" [See, for instance, @goldstoneGlobalModelForecasting2010]. Furthermore, other common measurements of political stability or instability are the frequencies of cabinet changes and regime duration (or regime change). The long list of authors who use this method include Alesina et al. [-@alesinaPoliticalInstabilityEconomic1996] in their investigation of the impacts of political instability economic growth, Hegre et al. [-@hegreDemocraticCivilPeace2001] in their study on the association between regime type and national security, and Gates et al. [-@gatesInstitutionalInconsistencyPolitical2006a] in their examination of "how political institutional structures affect political instability." Still, a closer look at the concept of political instability "using 25 political instability indicators in an Exploratory Factor Analysis," allow Richard Jong-A-Pin to suggest four dimensions of political instability:  "(1) politically motivated violence, (2) mass civil protest, (3) instability within the political regime, and (4) instability of the political regime." [@jong-a-pinMeasurementPoliticalInstability2009, p. 16]   

More recently, however, the World Bank and different authors adopt the definition and measurement of "Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism (PV)" by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi, as part of their work on the World Governance Indicators (WGI). [See @worldbankWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2016; and @kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011] "Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism (PV)" or simply "political stability" is here defined as "the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including politically-motivated violence and terrorism. [@kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011, p. 4] Most importantly, Kaufman et al.'s innovation in this project is to "rely exclusively on perceptions-based governance data sources." [@kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011, p. 5] As they explain, "Our data sources include surveys of firms and households, as well as the subjective assessments of a variety of commercial business information providers, non-governmental organizations, and a number of multilateral organizations and other public-sector bodies." [@kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011, p. 5]   

It is also worth noting that "political stability" is considered by the authors as one of the "six dimensions of governance," which include: "Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption." [@kaufmannWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2011, p. 4]   

After comparing Kaufmann et al.'s definition and measurement of political stability with those of other scholars, we also decide to adopt the former's definition and measurement in this book for two main reasons. First, since the concept of stability is highly subjective, it makes sense to use the measurement technique based on intersubjectivity, which is commonly used in qualitative research methods.[Among many other references, see @hollwayDoingQualitativeResearch2000; @charmazConstructingGroundedTheory2006] Second, using these definition and measurement, Kaufmann et al. are able to build and maintain a consistent database on political stability for most countries in the world since 1996, that can be accessed through the World Bank's databank website.[@worldbankWorldwideGovernanceIndicators2016]
