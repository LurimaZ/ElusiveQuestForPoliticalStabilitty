# Elusive Quest For Political Stability in Post-Cold War Africa

This is my research project on the "Elusive Quest for Political Stability in Post-Cold War Africa," which I started in 2016, as I was completing my book on "The Political Crisis of March 2009 in Madagascar". However, I encountered some problems concerning at the beginning (2017-2018) and had to restart it in the Fall of 2018. Some of the early problems I had to face concern:
1) the focus and objectives of this study: I struggle with the questions of what exactly I wanted to study and what I want to accomplish.
2) the approach and methodology to be used: I was not able to clearly define what is political stability. Hence, I was not sure how to approach it and what kinds of methods to use.

This semester (Fall 2018), as I am taking my semester sabbatical leave, I redefine the focus and objectives of this study. In addition, I also made a decision on the approach and methods to be used in this study.
