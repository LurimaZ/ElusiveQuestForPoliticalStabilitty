# ElusiveQuestForPoliticalStabilitty

This is my project on the "Elusive Quest for Political Stability in Post-Cold War Africa." I started this project in 2017, but I encountered some problems concerning:
1) the focus and objectives of this study: I struggle with the questions of what exactly I wanted to study and what I want to accomplish.

This year, as I prepared for and undertook my semester sabbatical leave, I redefine the focus and objectives of this study. In addition, I also made a decision on the approach and methods to be used in this study.
