# Elusive Quest For Political Stability in Post-Cold War Africa

This is my research project on the "Elusive Quest for Political Stability in Post-Cold War Africa," which I started in 2016, as I was completing my book on "The Political Crisis of March 2009 in Madagascar". However, I encountered some problems concerning at the beginning (2017-2018) and had to restart it in the Fall of 2018. Some of the early problems I had to face concern:   

1. the focus and objectives of this study: I struggle with the questions of what exactly I wanted to study and what I want to accomplish.
2. the approach and methodology to be used: I was not able to clearly define what is political stability. Hence, I was not sure how to approach it and what kinds of methods to use.

This semester (Fall 2018), as I am taking my semester sabbatical leave, I redefine the focus and objectives of this study. In addition, I also made a decision on the approach and methods to be used in this study.

## The focus:   

The conditions and triggers (or factors) of political stability, instability and crisis in Post-Cold War Africa (i.e., since 1996, because the data on political stability became available since that date)

## The Objectives:   

1. To identify what are the conditions of stability, instability and crisis: for example, what level of development and democracy (or voice and accountability or religious toleration) can make a country stable, and what level of development and democracy can make a country susceptible to instability and crisis?
2. To identify the most common triggers (or escalators) of conflict that can lead to instability and crisis

##  The approach:   

I use the same approach as the approach I used in my book "The Political Crisis in March 2009 in Madagascar", which I described as a "conflict approach."

## The methodology:   

This research project combines quantitative and qualitative methods.
