## September 2018

- 9/16/2018: I restarted this research project with a new r project entitled "ELUSIVE QUEST" under the "AFRICAN POLITICS RESEARCH" in my dropbox. I choose the title "ELUSIVE QUEST" to preserve the files I already created in the old project "ELUSIVE QUEST FOR POLITICAL STABILITY'.
This new r project was created with a new gitHub repository entitled "ElusiveQuestForPoliticalStabilitty" and a version control on git.

  . I will start the data collection and cleaning this week, at the same time, I will take a new course on this subject on DataCamp.

- 9/18/2018: completed the course on data importing and cleaning on DataCamp.  
Now I need to move to some serious stuff.  

- 9/19/2018: I realized that I still need to learn how to download, read and save qualitative data (news, reports and analysis on conflicts) in r. So I decided to take another course on "Working with Web Data in R" on DataCamp. I plan to comoplete this course in 3 to 4 days. At the same time, I need to start collecting and cleaning the quantitative data from the Word Bank.

- 9/20&21/2018: I looked at different techniques to collect qualitative data available online. I was able to write a script on how to do that. See `scriptForDownloadingQualitativeData` and `scriptForCollectingQualiativeData`.

- 9/22/2018: I continued learning and refreshing memory about importing, cleaning, and manipulating data in base r and dplyr.

- Next: I need to continue downloading and cleaning data from the World Bank, Freedom House and Polity IV.
