## September 2018

- 9/16/2018: I restarted this research project with a new r project entitled "ELUSIVE QUEST" under the "AFRICAN POLITICS RESEARCH" in my dropbox. I choose the title "ELUSIVE QUEST" to preserve the files I already created in the old project "ELUSIVE QUEST FOR POLITICAL STABILITY'.
This new r project was created with a new gitHub repository entitled "ElusiveQuestForPoliticalStabilitty" and a version control on git.

I will start the data collection and cleaning this week, at the same time, I will take a new course on this subject on DataCamp.
