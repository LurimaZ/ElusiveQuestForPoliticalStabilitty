```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## First Approach: Using `download.file`

We can directly download the webpage to a local repository using `download.file`, as shown in the example of the civil war in Sudan from Wikipedia:

```{r}
library(rvest)
Url <- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War'
Sudan1 <- download.file(Url, destfile = "qualitativeData/Sudan1.html")


```
